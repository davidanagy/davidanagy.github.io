## Data Science

**Sanctions Explorer**

A website constructed for our client, the [Center for Advanced Defense Studies](https://c4ads.org/), that allows users to search through current and historical sanctions data. Worked as a Data Scientist in an 8-member remote team to construct this website from scratch over the course of six weeks. I accomplished many tasks during this time, including (a) designing endpoints for the frontend; (b) wrangling the data and making additional key features; (c) scraping UN Panel of Expert reports and making them searchable.

(Link and GitHub not available; the code is owned by the client and they are not ready for the site to be publicly accessed)

**Predicting NBA Assists**

An app that predicts assists per game totals for all NBA players during the 2019-2020 season. I developed this myself over the course of 4 days, using data from [https://www.basketball-reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com) and applying a Ridge Regression model for the predictions.

Built using Plotly Dash and Python 3 (Jupyter notebooks).

**Suggest.It Subreddit Locator**

An app where users submit a Reddit post, and get shown suggested subreddits that would be appropriate for that post. I was a Data Engineer on a 9-member remote team; my fellow Data Engineer and I wrote a Flask app to connect the web frontend with the predictive model.

Built using Python 3; data obtained from the Reddit API.

**Spotify Song Suggester**

An app where users select their favorite songs and get a list of other recommended songs, in addition to data on the songs in question. I was a Machine Learning Engineer on a 10-member remote team. My fellow ML Engineers and I performed K-cluster analysis to get the suggested songs and wrote code to dynamically construct aesthetically pleasing visualizations for each song data.

Built using Python 3 (Jupyter notebooks); data obtained from the Spotify API.

**Analyzing US Home and Rent Prices**

I analyze data for median home sale and rent listing prices, and find both obvious and surprising results.

Built using Python 3 (Google Collaboratory).

## Philosophy

**The Origin of Power in the Need to Cooperate: Parallels Between Political and Economic Power**

My doctoral dissertation; I argue that both political and economic power are based on the need for people to follow common rules and/or leaders in order to cooperate with each other.
