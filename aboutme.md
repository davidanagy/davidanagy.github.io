Hello! I'm David Nagy. While we can capture many things with data, it's difficult to enframe the totality of a person's life. But I will do my best.

### (Short) Biography

I've spent much of my life studying philosophy, as an undergrad at California State University, Los Angeles (graduated 2009) and a PhD student at the City University of New York (graduated September 2019). While I still love philsosophy, I've come to realize the importance of data--and particularly, the understanding and manipulation of data--in our modern world. Philosophy, to me, is the search for truth, and there is much truth to be found in the vast sea of numbers, if only we know where to look.
